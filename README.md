# Triangle Tracker

Author: Vivvianne Kimani

## Project Description
This program allows users to enter dimensions of triangles and depending on the input, they are able to find the type of triangle they've created. It can also tell you if the values you have keyed in cannot make a triangle.

## Setup instructions
A user should enter dimensions of a triangle in the input fields provided then click on the Answer button to find out the type of triangle they've created.

## Project breakdown
The program allows a user to enter numbers in the given input fields. The dimensions to be analyzed have to be 3 in total, i.e., sideAB, sideAC and sideBC. After assessment, the user is notified about what type of triangle has the given dimensions. If the user enters 3 exact numbers in the input fields, then they get an alert notifying them that they've created an Equilateral triangle. If the user enter similar dimensions for any two sides, they create an Isosceles triangle. If all the dimensions entered are different, they get a Scalene triangle. Finally, if the sum of any two dimensions of the triangle is less than or equal to the length of the 3rd side, they get an alert that they haven't created a triangle. If you enter 0 in all the input fields, then the alert will be invalid.
